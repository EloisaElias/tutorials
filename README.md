# Code Tutorials

This repository contains a handful of tutorials, walk-throughs, and code snippets that I have either found useful or think I will find useful for the future. It is mainly so that I can go back and reference things that I have done, but anyone viewing is more than welcome to use any bits that they would like.

I make no guarantee that these bits of code follow any sort of "best-practice" or that they're the right way to do things. It is simply a collection of things that I have found useful and solutions to problems that I have had.

Thanks for looking, and feel free to open up any issues or bug reports if you think that I should change something.
