It is mainly so that I can go back and reference things that I have done, but anyone viewing is more than welcome to use any bits that they would like.\r\n\r\nI make no guarantee that these bits of code follow any sort of \"best-practice\" or that they're the right way to do things. It is simply a collection of things that I have found useful and solutions to problems that I have had.\r\n\r\nThanks for looking, and feel free to open up any issues or bug reports if you think that I should change something.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
